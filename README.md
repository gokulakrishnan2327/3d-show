# 3D Product Showcase

This is a React-based 3D product showcase app where users can interact with a 3D model of a product, change its textures, and control the scene using a set of buttons. The app uses **react-three/fiber** for rendering 3D content and **@react-three/drei** for additional 3D controls and features.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Product**: Display a 3D model (sphere in this case) with dynamic textures (e.g., default, metal, wood).
- **Control Interface**: Buttons to change the texture of the product in real time.
- **Scene Lighting**: Ambient, directional, and point lights for proper 3D rendering.
- **Skybox Background**: A customized background color for the scene.
- **3D Controls**: Orbit controls for rotating, zooming, and panning the 3D scene.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **react-three/fiber**: React renderer for three.js, allowing you to build 3D scenes in React.
- **@react-three/drei**: A collection of useful helpers for react-three/fiber, including `Html`, `OrbitControls`, and others.
- **three.js**: The core 3D library used by react-three/fiber.
- **CSS**: Styling for UI elements.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** or **yarn**: Make sure you have npm or yarn installed for package management.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokulakrishnan2327/3d-show.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-show
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

- **src/**: Contains all the source code files.
  - **components/**: React components for the app, including the product, skybox, lighting, and controls.
  - **App.js**: The main entry file that contains the `Canvas` component and renders all the 3D elements.
  - **styles.css**: Styling for the app, including the control buttons and UI.
- **public/**: Contains static files like images and the HTML template.
  - **images/**: Stores the textures for the 3D product.
    - `nuria_portfolio.jpg`: Default texture.
    - `OIP.jpg`: Metal texture.
    - `abstract-3d-colorful-object-background_781958-8865.avif`: Wood texture.

## How It Works

1. **Textures**: The product (modeled as a sphere) has three possible textures (default, metal, and wood) that can be changed using the buttons in the control panel.
2. **Lighting**: The scene uses ambient, directional, and point lights to ensure proper visibility and effects for the 3D model.
3. **Orbit Controls**: Users can interact with the 3D scene by rotating, zooming, and panning using the orbit controls.
